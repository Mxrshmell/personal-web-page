            <h3>Wrestling</h3>
            <p>Wrestling is a fun sport for people who likes having a challenge against a person in front of you the good thing about wrestling is that it is not a team sport really because you can decide your own fate all you have to do is just train and get better because being strong won't really help you in the sport of wrestling the sport of wrestling is about technique.</p>

                <p>One thing you will need for wrestling are wrestling shoes and people usually go for good looking shoes or shoes with different type of styles because they feel like it could make them a better wrestler but thats not how it works you need to get wrestling shoes that will feel good and comfortable around your feet and not shoes that make your feet hurt but your just wearing them because they look good</p>

            <h3>Head Gear</h3>
            <P>Wrestling headgear can be affective in so many ways when it comes to wrestling and the goods things about wrestling headgear is that there are many types of wrestling headgear that you could choose from usually every one that first starts to wrestle they get the headgear that has a line at the bottom to go across your chin but that headgear isn't comfortable for most people because it feels like the headgear is choking them so they get the headgear with the cup on it to go around your chin</P>
